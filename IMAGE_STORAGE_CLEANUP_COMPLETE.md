# Image Storage Cleanup System - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Image Cleanup

- **When updating products**: Old images are automatically deleted from storage when new images replace them
- **When deleting products**: All product images are deleted from storage during soft delete
- **When removing individual images**: Images are deleted from storage immediately when removed from product

### 2. Storage Management APIs

- **DELETE /api/delete-image**: Delete individual images from storage by path
- **POST /api/admin/storage**: Admin endpoint for storage stats and manual cleanup
  - `action: 'stats'` - Get storage usage statistics
  - `action: 'cleanup'` - Run orphaned image cleanup

### 3. Enhanced Components

- **ImageUpload Component**: Now deletes images from storage when removed from UI
- **ProductService**: Automatically handles image cleanup during product operations
- **Storage Utils**: Utility functions for image path extraction and cleanup operations

### 4. Admin Storage Management Page

- **Storage Statistics**: View total files and storage usage
- **Manual Cleanup**: Remove orphaned images not referenced by any product
- **Cleanup Results**: View detailed results of cleanup operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh stats and see immediate results

components/admin/products/
  └── image-upload.tsx             # Enhanced with cleanup on remove
```

### Database Integration

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Integrated into existing product CRUD operations
- **Path Extraction**: Smart URL parsing to extract storage paths
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if storage operations fail

### Storage Bucket Configuration

- **Bucket**: `product-images`
- **Path Structure**: `products/{timestamp-random}.{ext}`
- **Policies**: Public read access with authenticated write

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Automatic Cleanup (No Code Required)

- Upload images to product → Storage used
- Remove images from product → Storage freed automatically
- Update product images → Old images deleted, new images stored
- Delete product → All product images removed from storage

### Manual Cleanup (Admin Panel)

1. Navigate to `/admin/storage`
2. Click "Refresh Stats" to see current usage
3. Click "Run Cleanup" to remove orphaned files
4. View detailed cleanup results

### API Usage

```typescript
// Get storage stats
const response = await fetch("/api/admin/storage", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ action: "stats" }),
});

// Run cleanup
const response = await fetch("/api/admin/storage", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ action: "cleanup" }),
});

// Delete specific image
const response = await fetch(`/api/delete-image?path=${imagePath}`, {
  method: "DELETE",
});
```

## 📊 Benefits

### Storage Efficiency

- ✅ **No Orphaned Files**: Automatic cleanup prevents unused images
- ✅ **Immediate Cleanup**: Images deleted as soon as they're not needed
- ✅ **Space Monitoring**: Real-time storage usage tracking

### User Experience

- ✅ **Seamless Operations**: Cleanup happens automatically in background
- ✅ **Visual Feedback**: Users see immediate UI updates when removing images
- ✅ **Admin Control**: Storage management tools for administrators

### Performance

- ✅ **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database queries for finding orphaned files
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Multiple files deleted in single operation when possible
- ✅ **Error Resilience**: UI operations continue even if storage cleanup fails

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Graceful Fallbacks

- If storage deletion fails, UI operations still complete
- Error logging for debugging without blocking user actions
- Retry mechanisms for transient storage errors

### Admin Monitoring

- Detailed error reporting in admin panel
- Success/failure tracking for cleanup operations
- Storage usage trending and monitoring

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

- Uses existing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for storage operations
- No additional configuration required

### Storage Policies

- Public read access for image display
- Authenticated write/delete access for security
- Automatic cleanup policies in place

## 📝 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- Monitor storage usage via admin panel
- Run manual cleanup periodically if needed
- Review error logs for any failed operations

### Monitoring Points

- Total storage usage growth over time
- Number of orphaned files found during cleanup
- Failed deletion attempts and their causes
