# ✅ Fixed: Supabase Server Environment Variables Error

## 🐛 Issue Description

The application was throwing a runtime error: "Missing Supabase server environment variables" when trying to access storage utilities in client-side components.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The problem was caused by importing server-side utilities (`supabaseServiceRole`) in client-side components:

```typescript
// ❌ This was causing the error
import { extractImagePath } from "@/lib/storage-utils";
// storage-utils.ts was importing supabaseServiceRole (server-only)
```

Server-side environment variables (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) are not available in client-side code, causing the error when Next.js tried to bundle these modules for the browser.

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### 1. Separated Client and Server Utilities

**Before (❌):**

- `storage-utils.ts` - Mixed client and server functions
- Client components importing server-only functions

**After (✅):**

- `storage-utils.ts` - Client-safe utilities only
- `storage-server-utils.ts` - Server-only functions
- Clear separation between client and server code

### 2. File Structure Changes

```
lib/
├── storage-utils.ts           # Client-safe utilities
│   ├── extractImagePath()     # ✅ Client-safe
│   └── StorageCleanupResult   # ✅ Type definition
│
└── storage-server-utils.ts    # Server-only utilities
    ├── deleteImageFromStorage()      # 🔒 Server-only
    ├── deleteMultipleImagesFromStorage() # 🔒 Server-only
    ├── cleanupOrphanedImages()       # 🔒 Server-only
    └── getStorageStats()             # 🔒 Server-only
```

### 3. Updated Imports

**Client Components:**

```typescript
// ✅ Now only imports client-safe functions
import { extractImagePath } from "@/lib/storage-utils";
```

**Server Components/API Routes:**

```typescript
// ✅ Server functions from server utils
import {
  deleteImageFromStorage,
  cleanupOrphanedImages,
  getStorageStats,
} from "@/lib/storage-server-utils";
// ✅ Client functions still available
import { extractImagePath } from "@/lib/storage-utils";
```

### 4. Components Fixed

- ✅ `ImageUpload` component - Now client-safe
- ✅ `ProductFormDialog` - Now client-safe
- ✅ `ProductService` - Uses correct server imports
- ✅ API routes - Uses server utilities properly

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Working Functions:

- **Image Upload**: Upload images to products ✓
- **Image Removal**: Remove individual images with storage cleanup ✓
- **Product Updates**: Update products with automatic old image cleanup ✓
- **Product Deletion**: Delete products with complete image cleanup ✓
- **Storage Management**: Admin storage page works ✓

### ✅ Runtime Status:

- **No more client-side errors** ✓
- **Server starts successfully** ✓
- **All storage operations functional** ✓
- **Proper environment variable access** ✓

## 🔧 Key Principles Applied

1. **Client-Server Separation**: Clear distinction between client and server code
2. **Environment Variable Safety**: Server environment variables only accessed server-side
3. **Type Safety**: Shared interfaces between client and server
4. **Functionality Preservation**: All original features still work

## 📝 Files Modified

- `lib/storage-utils.ts` - Removed server functions
- `lib/storage-server-utils.ts` - Created with server functions
- `lib/services/product-service.ts` - Updated imports
- `app/api/admin/storage/route.ts` - Updated imports
- `app/api/delete-image/route.ts` - Updated implementation
- `lib/test-storage-cleanup.ts` - Updated imports

## 🚀 Result

The storage cleanup system is now fully functional with proper client-server separation. No more runtime errors and all image management features work as expected.

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED - Ready for Production Use**
